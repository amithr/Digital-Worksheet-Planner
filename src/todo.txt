- Make the user interface drag-and-drop enabled (introduce positions that can be saved into the activity)
- Instead of passing different activity attributes, just pass the activity in the WorksheetActivityArea
- Implement unit testing for helpers and integration testing for the app (when it's 75% finished)
- Implement answer submission feedback (especially in Gapfill)
- Initialize state in constructor instead of populateComponent function
- Use popmotion.io to animate certain aspects?
